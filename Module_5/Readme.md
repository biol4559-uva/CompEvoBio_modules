# **Module 5**

## Overview
There are three different assignments in Module 5:

1.  [Coverage exploration](/Module_5/coverage_instructions.md)
2.  [Effective Coverage](/Module_5/effective_coverage.md)
3.  [Site Frequency Spectrum](/Module_5/SFS_instructions.md)

To run these scripts, you'll need to copy some files over to your scratch:
```
mkdir /scratch/COMPUTEID/coverage
cp -R /standard/vol186/bergland-lab/biol4559-aob2x/ /scratch/COMPUTEID/coverage/.
```
