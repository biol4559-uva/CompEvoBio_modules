### libraries

  library(ggplot2)
  library(data.table)

### write a function that takes two parameters, the number of chromosomes in a sample and the read depth and returns effective coverage
### have it spit out a data.table with three columns: rd, nChr, and effective_coverage

### use your function to solve the assignment:
### Oops - your friend forgot to record whether they used a pool of male or female flies and isn't thinking about any potential consequences of their mistake.
### They figured, "Hey - a fly is a fly so it probably doesn't matter too much."
### They have read some of Professor Bergland's papers and so they are aware of the idea of effective coverage but did not factor in their mistake about the sex-ratio of their sample, and assumed that their samples were all female.
### They used 50 flies and have an average coverage of 45 on the autosomes, and 22.5 on the X chromosome.
### What is the effective coverage that they report, and what is the effective coverage that they should have reported?
