The goal of class today is to examine some patterns of allele frequency change along the genome.

There are about a gazillion ways of doing this, and in class today we will learn a few approaches. In later weeks we will refine these approaches in different ways.

Before we begin today, you all need to copy an updated version of the GDS. This is because I made a typo when the GDS was being constructed. The previous version only contained information from chromosome 2L for the experimental evolution work. For all of your studies, information on 2R, 3L, 3R, and X was shown as missing data.
