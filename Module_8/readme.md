The goal of class today is to examine some patterns of allele frequency change along the genome.

There are about a gazillion ways of doing this, and in class today we will learn a few approaches. In later weeks we will refine these approaches in different ways.

1. [Inversions](/Module_8/inversions_instructions.md)
2. [Sliding Window](/Module_8/sliding_window_instructions.md)
3. [Simple Scatter-Gather](/Module_8/scatter_gather.md)
