# **SLURM**

## Overview
Up to this point, we have been using Rivanna in an interactive way. That is great when we are analyzing data and learning to code. But, sometimes, we need to let Rivanna work for hours and we want it to run in the background. To submit jobs to Rivanna, we use the job handler SLURM.

Goals:
1. learn about the structure of a SLURM file
2. learn about modules on Rivanna

Objective:
1. Run a quality control tool on FASTQ files for your paper using a slurm script

## Instructions
1. Open a new Rstudio job. For this exercise, we are only going to 

2. make two new directories in the terminal:
```
mkdir /scratch/aob2x/logs/
