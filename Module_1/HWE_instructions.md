# **Instructions for HWE in-class assignment**

## Overview
In this exercise, you will examine the features of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to gain a better understanding of some aspects of allele frequency change, and to learn technical skills used throughout this class.

Objectives:
1. Use Rstudio on Rivanna for basic scripting.
2. Learn about basic object types in R, and make a function in R
3. Plot data that you generate using your function

Goals:
1.	Increased familiarity with R.
2.	Increased understanding of allele frequencies, precision, and statistical tests

## Steps
1.	Log into [OpenOneDemand](https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) and start an interactive Rstudio job.

2. Select the options below. Why do these options matter (we’ll discuss but here is the notes)
>a.	Version = which libraries to use<br>
b.	Partition = what sort of computer your job gets given to, constraints, SU<br>
c.	Hours = Your Rstudio session will terminate after this amount of time<br>
d.	Cores = billable SU (service unit)<br>
e.	Memory = for small jobs like this lesson we only need 6Gb<br>
f.	Allocation = the account to bill SUs to. The instructional allocation prioritizes our jobs during our class-time so that we don’t have to wait. bio4559-aob2x<br>
