# **Sample Metadata instructions**

## Overview
We need to assemble metadata associated with our FASTQ files in order to interpret the data later on. The metadata will include information about the experimental treatments, the origin of the base fly population, the experimental details. You will need to revisit the paper, and possibly dig around in the literature a bit. You should also consult the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) by searching for the bioproject associated with your paper. You will also need to consult with this data sheet that contains the SRA bioproject and accession IDs. [you can find that file here](/data/SRA_accessions_v2.xlsx).

Goals:
1. Explore the stated origin of the samples

Objective:
1. Make two files. One is a detailed Excel sheet, the other is a simple text file. Examples below

## Instructions
1. Working with your group, fill in your samples using the `CompEvoBio_modules/Module_3/SampleMetatdata_template.xlsx` file as your template.

2. You can find more information about each sample in this file `CompEvoBio_modules/Module_3/SampleMetaData.pptx`.

3. Once you have filled out that sheet, make a simple table like `CompEvoBio_modules/Module_3/sras.txt`. It is a comma separated file with no spaces, that has 3 columns: the SRR number, the number of flies, the sample names.

4. To complete this assignment, submit both documents to Canvas as a group submission.
