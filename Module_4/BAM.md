# **Sex Ratio**

## Overview
Dangit! Someone forgot to write down whether your samples were pools of male or female flies. Using information about the where reads are mapping in the genome, determine if your samples are pools of 100% males, 100% females, or a mixture. If a mixture, can you figure out the proportion?

Goals:
1. Challenge yourself to implement a solution to this problem with little instruction :-)

Objectives.
1. Estimate the sex-ratio of all your samples

## Instructions
1. Use the tools that we discussed today to solve the assignment.
2. Upload your script to GitHub and answer the Canvas assignment.
